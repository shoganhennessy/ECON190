# Paper: stylised model for mobility:  The Haves and the Have-Nots.
# Note the idea in the paper may be extended to more groups than two, run simulations on this.




# Idea 1. Clutsering in big data set (CPS, questions over panel)

# COmpare composition of clusters, why and how.
# Importantly: are there haves and have-not split?

# Idea 2. Paper that takes OLS residuals as unobserved skill.

# Run again, with CPS and other data set.
# Run with better predictive models.
# Does increased variance in error terms go away?  If so, attribute to over-reliance on OLD framework.
